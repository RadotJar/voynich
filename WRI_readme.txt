# NOTE: This is probably a contender for the worst code I have ever written, but at the time I really just needed something that simply worked

Program basically repeats the same code to individuallty plot the results for each text on the plot. WRI_all has a maximum of 5 texts.
Other other programs are titled WRI_[number] to indicate the number of texts that can be plotted. For example, WRI_3 can plot 3 texts. It's basically the same
code repeated multiple times throughout the script.

User simply needs to specify the directory for the texts where prompted in the script

Names of plots can be changed at the user's leisure

Outputs are sent to the 'WRI_figures directory'

WRC refers to 'word recurring characters', which is just makes a bar plot of the characters which recur in the recurring words. The results are 
sent to the 'WRC_figures' folder. The results weren't to indicative of anything as described in the report

'WRI' folder just consists of the output of test scripts
